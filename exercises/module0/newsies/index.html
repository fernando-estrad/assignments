        <h1>Texas Shooter Gunned Down</h1>

        <p>WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas â€” Midway through a Sunday church 
            service in the suburbs of Fort Worth, an all-too-familiar scene 
            began to unfold: A man in a trench coat rose from the pews, pulled 
            out a shotgun and opened fire, prompting terrified churchgoers to dive 
            for cover.</p>
        <p>But this was Texas, where a pair of state laws adopted since 2017 not 
            only authorize armed security details at houses of worship, but also allow
            parishioners to bring their own weapons to church.</p>
        <p>Within seconds, a volunteer security guard near the back of the West Freeway 
            Church of Christ pulled out his Sig Sauer pistol and fired back. One after 
            another, at least half a dozen other parishioners drew their own weapons and 
            began moving up the aisles</p>
        <p>A woman in one of the middle pews, holding a handgun aloft, calmly guided 
            terrified churchgoers to safety as the pastor crawled down from the pulpit 
            on all fours.</p>
